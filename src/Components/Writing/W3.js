    “Do you think Sisyphus was Happy?” asked a friend of mine. I replied saying “who is sisyphus?”.  Sisyphus, as explained by my friend is a part of Greek mythology. He was the king of Ephyra who was punished by the gods for his greed and craftiness by being forced to push an enormous boulder up a hill. Sisyphus had to spend the rest of his life pushing a boulder up a hill. Why would he be happy? He’ll have to spend the rest of his life doing the same thing again and again. Then it hit me. Most of us are sisyphus in real lives. We will spend the rest of our lives doing the same job, following the same routine for the rest of our lives. We will spend the rest of our life being a cog in a machine. Most of us won’t do something extraordinary in our lives, most of us won’t create a cure to cancer, we will not go to space, or we not build a multinational company.  Will we not be happy. What’s the point then? These are the questions that existentialists asks themselves and go down a loop hole of sadness. 	And honestly most of us think about things like these at some points of life. But what makes me evade all these questions is by imagining sisyphus happy. This idea was presented by the philosopher Albert Camus. If all of us sisyphus’s imagine having fun doing all the mundane and repetitive things in life, our lives will become a lot more bearable, a lot more livable, a lot more happier.     </p>
