        I was locked in my house. So were everyone. Some Chinese virus had broken loose. College was online, which meant there was no college. I googled whats the best show of all time. Imdb said breaking bad. Without giving it another thought I pirated the entire show (I have stopped pirating). After watching the first few episodes I was hooked. I watched breaking bad day and night, until I finished the show. The visual language of the show, the writing, the ending, everything was perfect for me. Breaking bad made me want to go to Albuquerque, go looking for the White family, Saul, and see how they were doing. It was, and I thought will be the best show ever made. When better call Saul came out I was very skeptical of watching it. I didn’t want the universe of breaking bad ruined by a spinoff. How could any spinoff top the magic of breaking bad. For quite some time I stayed away from the show.  Until I was again at my home, we had a long summer break, not a lot to do, and after a lot of resistance, I finally gave it a chance. Better call Saul is the origin story of Saul Goodman. I liked Saul before Better call Saul. He always gave a comic relief to breaking bad. But when you have characters like Jesse and Walt, you don’t really think about side characters. Better Call Saul changed that. This show made me realise that very small, subtle moments of life, compounds over time to shape your Identity. The moments of his life where he seeks validation, from his father, brother, and when he does not get it, he turns to his old ways of slippin’ Jimmy. This is why the story of Jimmy feels so relatable. Everyone is seeking validation in some form or the other. Had Jimmy gotten the  validation from his brother, there would be no Saul Goodman. The entire show is in some form the study of Identity. Identity is a fascinating and intricate concept, deeply embedded in the human experience. We are continuously moulding and reshaping it, just as clay is kneaded and shaped by a potter. In the world of television, this process is brought to life through the dynamic evolution of characters, providing viewers with a lens to scrutinize and reflect upon their own identities. The identities of Saul Goodman and Heisenberg are not mere disguises or facades. They are living, evolving identities that are shaped by their interactions with the world around them and their internal emotional landscapes. These characters serve as a potent reminder that identity is not static but dynamic, continuously in flux.
