            I am at the top of a mountain. I look down on everyone else. Everybody looks up to me. I am so high that I see no one. I have a mansion with all the money I want, all the cars I like, all the food I want to eat, but no humans, it's just me. My mansion is huge. But my room, its small, to not let me realize the depth of my aloneness. I have a huge dining table, but only one chair. I have great pride in the fact that I have conquered the world, defeated my enemies, proved all my doubters wrong. But deep within me is a voice that says you have no one. Was all of this climbing worth it?
