        A drunk man's words are the reflection of his reality, his dreams, his regrets. He wants to talk to the people he can't talk to in real life. He talks about things he can’t say sober. It liberates a man, from his inferiority, from his deep sunken thoughts. The problem with alcohol starts when one starts believing his drunk self is true self, unburdened and authentic. This illusion can be intoxicating, as it convinces one that their identity lies within the altered state rather than their sober reality. However, the drunk self is often a distorted version—raw, yes, but lacking clarity and restraint. The problem deepens when a person begins to rely on this version to confront their fears, express emotions, or seek validation. It’s a fragile crutch, one that erodes the foundation of genuine self-awareness and connection. True liberation comes not from intoxication but from confronting those same fears and desires with a clear mind and open heart.
