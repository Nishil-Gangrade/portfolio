      The other day i got to visit Mumbai with my friends. Mumbai has always been close to my heart. A lot of my childhood memories come from this place. When I stood in front of the Taj, it reminded me of the time when my nana held me in his arms and told me that the tea inside is very expensive. And now i was standing there telling my friends that the tea inside is really expensive not really knowing how expensive the tea really is. Not much has changed i guess. But this time around Mumbai made me think. Think a lot actually. Standing next to the gateway of India, with pigeons flying around, pleasing sea breeze, I had made my mind that this is the gateway to the city of dreams. Just then a woman with a small baby in her hands came to me and asked for some money saying she hasn’t eaten for a day. I wondered if she thinks of mumbai as the city of dreams. I highly doubt. Wandering around the streets of mumbai with picturesque British architecture, buildings that could not get any more aesthetic, I saw huge fancy cafes with people drinking their cup of CAFFE MOCHA one sip every few minutes. They seem to have all the time in the world. Just a head twist and i could see people running, trying to get their work done. I saw people trying to get inside jam packed locals, fighting for even an inch. I saw young men, probably in their 20’s giving money to 60 year old coolies asking them to carry their luggage. All of this made me think of Mumbai as the city of nightmares.
