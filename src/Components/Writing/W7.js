          Interstellar is the kind of film that you can rewatch any number of times and still have the same amount of curiosity and love for it. I try to watch the movie at least once a month, it keeps me grounded and makes me realize that there is so much more to achieve. It hits me with the realization that we are insignificant beings and venturing into the vast unknowns is what gives meaning to life.

          Interstellar reinstates the fact that human beings are driven by irrational things like love, things which cannot be reduced to biology, and this irrationality is what gives humans their human-ness. Love is why we survive and and is what gives meaning to our survival. A simple act of kindness, a simple complement might seem insignificant but might make someones day and stay with them for the rest of their lives.

          Nolan has this special ability of leaving the audience in awe at the very end of his films. Dark knight, Inception, Oppenheimer, prestige, all left with me with goosebumps at the end. But the ending of interstellar hits different. We believe that Cooper and Murph would reunite and stay together ever after. All Murph wanted was to meet her father. But their meeting is very brief, its because their love has already served its purpose.  Sometimes love can also meaning letting go of someone.
